## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- According to the results the vehicle length, and ground results (as well as the intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of    variance to the linear model.
- The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is not zero, so the slope is not considered to be zero
- The Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149 which means that the predictions will be accurate 71.49% of the time.
